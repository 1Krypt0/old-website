# Experience Summary

I am a fourth-year student currently getting a masters degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering. I love getting involved in new environments and meeting new people, because only then can I develop as a person and reach new heights.

During the summer of 2021, to challenge myself, I did a small internship at a company in my hometown, where I dealt with completely different circumstances compared to the ones faced in university, and had to learn new skills by myself, which in turn greatly improved my ability to learn on the fly and become even more passionate about this field. Also, during that year, university presented me with some projects which led me to love web development and everything related to it, making me want to learn more and more about it.

And, during last Christmas, my grandmother told me to choose a gift, and so I chose this! It is a great way to learn about a field I am fascinated by, and it is a great way to train and have a sandbox where I can try new things.

# Projects

## Websystems - Full Stack Web Developer

#### From July 2021 to September 2021

#### Description

The project intended to expand their administration dashboard, which was used to monitor assets about their clients, as well as serving as a task manager for the whole Websystems team.

My goal was to add the ability to store information about the hardware and software of all the different clients, namely their workstations, servers, printers, among many others, integrate with the rest of the information and create a new section in the dashboard for display.

To do this I had to update the database to include the new tables, develop the front-end for presentation and easy retrieval of the information, and the back-end for processing all of the information sent, using an MVC architecture as a basis for the structure.

#### Technologies used

- C# - Page Controllers and Models created using an Object Relational Mapper.
- ASP.NET Framework - Facilitating development of the application with built-in templates and tools.
- Microsoft SQL Server - DBMS used to store the information.
- HTML with Razor Templating Engine - Views and presentation of the information.
- CSS and JavaScript - Visual styling and animations in the presented page.

## Database and Web Applications Laboratory - Full Stack Web Developer

#### From November 2021 to January 2021

#### Description

In the project assigned, we had to create a social network from scratch, while following an agile development process and going through every single possible artifact, from user stories, database design, mockups and even prototypes.

It was the first full scale project we had, and I discovered that a lot of work goes to every stage of the process. Also, we used a framework for the first time, and I learned about most of the abstractions an MVC framework offers. Also, it was the first time we worked in a more structured style, with specific features being developed at specific times, which helped to understand the main priorities in the development cycle.

The end result was a functioning social network deployed in a remote host, with a working database and even some integrations with 3rd party APIs. This was the project that really made me appreciate web development and enjoy it a lot.

#### Technologies used

- Laravel - The PHP framwork used for developing most of the application. Using the built-in ORM and SSR engine, it made development seamless
- PostgresSQL - DBMS used to store the information, created remotely in a Docker container and managed with the Laravel ORM.
- HTML with Blade Templating Engine - Views and presentation of the information, with SSR.
- Bootstrap - Styling framework used to aid in development of a good-looking web app
- Javascript - Used in small bits to make some of the information fetching dynamic, instead of having to refresh the pages everytime.

## Capstone Project - Front-end Developer

#### From March 2022 to June 2022

#### Description

In the capstone project, my team had the goal of creating a way for less technical people to manage a website's content, while creating a solution that was lighter and faster than modern Content Management Systems like Wordpress. The idea was to have something between the ease of use of a CMS and the speed of a Static Site Generator.

The solution that we came up with was using an Excel spreadsheet as a database, making each sheet a table with a specific data model. Then, with a small API that we developed, that data could be injected into some Vue.js templates, creating the website in real time.

In this project we had to manage ourselves as a team, and I assumed a role of managing the tasks each member would do, creating a sort-of-Agile methodology more adapted to our needs. In the end I learned a lot about Front-End development with Vue.js, and became even more amazed with this field. It was also fun to create something that might really be used in the future, and had such a simple but effective solution.

#### Technologies used

- Vue.js - Framwork used for developing the front-end of the application and injecting the data.
- TailwindCSS - Styling framework that helped to create a responsive design for the website
- Typescript - Language chosen to create the API and used throghout the project for enforcing type-safety everywhere
- Excel - System used as storage for the website, with easy access to less technical people, but with really powerful features

## Personal - Installing and Configuring Arch Linux

#### From February 2021 to March 2021

#### Description

Installed and customized Arch Linux from scratch to learn more about how the operating systems work and have full control over my computing experience.

Having used Ubuntu for some university work, I became fascinated seeing what was possible to do in a Linux computer and how efficient some desktops were. So, during a vacation period, I created a second partition in my computer and installed Arch Linux, customizing it to fit my needs. After some long hours reading documentation, erasing and rewriting partitions and even starting completely from scratch several times, victory was finally achieved.

The result is a desktop that works how I want it and allows me to be much more efficient, aside from being a much better environment to work on. Also, I now have complete knowledge of what is installed in my computer and how everything works and interacts with it, giving me a greater knowledge about the different components, and lighting up a passion for keeping on learning and discovering more about this field. I may even write a post about it someday! :eyes:

#### Technologies used

- Arch Linux - Operating system of a certain complexity but not too exaggerated.
- Git - Management tool used for installing some extra packages not available in repositories.
- Vim and Doom Emacs - Text editors used for setting up the system (and to configure themselves).
- BSPWM - Window manager responsible for desktop configuration.
- SXHKD - Program responsible for managing key binds that are used in the system.
- Polybar - System bar with a set of useful widgets and information.
- Rofi - App Launcher and System Control Widgets.

## Personal - This website!

#### From December 2021 to Today

#### Description

Built my personal website and hosted on Github Pages, using a custom domain.

I always wanted a website, a place to share my thoughts with the world and one where I can build the experience users have when they enter. Finally, this Christmas, it happened (thanks Grandma).

To start, my grandma gifted me the domain. I had built some minor websites for university, but nothing like this. Since I never had built anything like this, I wanted to start by something small, in this case with a static website and a static website generator. I chose Hugo because it had some awesome themes and the setup was super quick. In the future I would love to build my own website template, but built from the ground up. Since I discovered the world of web development, Angular has always fascinated me (much more so than React). So stick around because in the future this website will probably be rebuilt with Angular and my very own CDN (it sounds impossible right now but a person can dream).

Even though it is not perfect, I have learned a great deal from assembling this, from linking domain names and redirects, SSL certificates, web hosting, and the art of publishing and keeping the local result the same as the remote one (an art that I learned by failing a lot of times, sadly). I also gained knowledge about the Jamstack and its benefits to the web (it is what I am using right now!), and finally, I gained a love for web development and a desire to learn a lot more than the small amount I know now. Hopefully in the future this will be one of my best projects!

#### Technologies used

- Hugo - Static Website Generator used.
- Github Pages - Web host, great for static websites.
- Doom Emacs - Text editor used for writing posts.
- [Hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) - Theme used to style the website.
