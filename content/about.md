My name is Tiago Rodrigues. I come from a little place in Portugal called Milhazes, and my goal in life is to try and learn as much as possible from everything. Some say that might be a bit too ambitious but hey, doesn't hurt to try, right?

That's probably why I started this little page as well, to try and create a record of what I am doing, where I am and share a bit of my life with anyone that might be interested.

You can find me in either Porto or Barcelos, depending on whether I am at university or chilling during my vacations.

# Education

I am studying Informatics and Computer Engineering in [FEUP](https://fe.up.pt) for a Masters degree. While at first I didn't even know how to code (to day this I remember the day when I found out you could have a nested for loop), now I can't imagine myself doing any other thing. It has been a crazy wild ride really, and I am loving it.

Before this, during high school, I went to Escola de Secund√°ria de Barcelos, where I graduated with 18.5 out of 20. Everyone's experience in high school is different but I think some of the best years of my life where spent in this school, maybe one day I'll even write about them.

# Fun Stuff I like doing

The thing I most enjoy doing in this world is definitely to travel (bonus points if I go with my girlfriend). If it was possible, I would love to one day visit every country in the world at least once, kind of like [this guy did](https://onestep4ward.com/my-journey-to-every-country-in-the-world-country-list-and-faq/), even though that would take a lifetime to complete.

If I am forced to be at home, then my favorite thing in the world is definitely tinkering with my computer, especially the software (I am studying software engineering after all). Maybe one day I will even show you my setup. When I want to go analog though, I usually try to read some books on how I can improve my life (I love stuff about habit-building and productivity in general), and recently I have discovered that I love learning new languages, and the less usual the better. Currently, I know Portuguese (duh) and English, and I am trying to learn German. Also I intend to one day expand to a language from out of Europe, like Mandarin.

Finally, one thing that the pandemic taught me was that I love to work out. Especially early in the morning, be it with calishtenics training or going on a run through the woods, I love the feeling it gives me and the energy I get for the rest of the day. If there is a habit that has transformed my life for the better, it is definitely this one.

# Wrapping up

As you can probably see I can find things that fascinate me in just about everything. If that is a blessing or a curse is up to you, but for me, it means that there will never be a dull moment in my life, and that I will always have something fun to talk about, be it with my lovely girlfriend, my family, my friends, and now with anyone that stumbles across this little piece of the internet. Enjoy!
