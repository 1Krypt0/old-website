I have to be honest, during week 1 I was terrible. Not because I found the training hard and was constantly sore from doing it, but because I didn't even actually train in most of the days. It felt terrible doing this to myself, even more when I was just starting and was supposed to at least try in the first week, it didn't go at all according to plan. Why did this happen, you ask? Well, its a combination of pressure from the projects at university and an unsuited environment

# University pressure

By the time I had planned to start this training, classes were just about to finish. With the end of classes here come two things: the due dates for all projects and the start of exam season. I was prepared for neither of these.

The projects I had been working on them all semester, and some of them were going really well (two of them were delivered a few days before the due date, and another was just needing some final touches). But the last project, and the worst one of them all, was total mess. It is really hard to make a project when the assignment in itself is terrible, and it was a horrible project to begin with, in a class with absolutely no guidance and with bad and borderline stupid requirements, but it is even worse when a project for 2 people was all done by only one. That's what happenned to me. The entire semester we had a clear division between what was to be done by who, and all my parts were completed on time and worked (even helping with some things along the way), but everything else never showed up.

That led to a 2 day rush to just finish what was possible and try to get as much done to at least come up with a decent thing, also on my own on these times. The result was a near total burnout and both physical and mental exhaustion. All to at least not straight up fail a terrible project. With all this, I lost two days of working out to making a project I am not even proud of and my entire willpower to wake up "on time" and take some time for physical exercise.
