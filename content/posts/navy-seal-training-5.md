This was most definitely a week of adaptation. After the first week of vacations had passed, I went back to my hometown to be with my parents for a while. This led to some great times of course, but also some workout difficulties.

# Choosing a new spot

In previous times, I would be fine working out in Barcelos, as I had a gym close to home during summer break. The problem is that I only could go to that gym for summer break. It didn't make sense for me to buy a subscription and then cancel it after only a week, paying a lot of extra money along the way.

That meant that for week 5, I wouldn't have access to a gym, so most of the workout was nullified. While a bit demotivating, I didn't want to give up on training completely for the week. So I tried to find the one thing that I thought I needed most to at least make some progress. And that is the humble bar.

## The search begins

The humble pull-up bar is the only real equipment I need to have a decent workout. "Why?", you ask? Well, there are great calisthenic exercises that can train the "push" muscles, like the chest, shoulders, and triceps.

But sadly, for the back and biceps, you can't really train them without "pulling" anything, and the easiest thing to pull is, well, your body. But for that, you need somewhere to pull your body from. Enter the bar. The pull-up and its variations are probably some of the best exercises for your back and biceps, and I wanted to keep them in decent shape.

So I set out to find a decent pull-up bar from walking distance of my home, so I could train there. I settled for quite an unusual place. A children's swing.

It was in a little public park close to home that was built recently, and during the day no one is there usually, so it was nearly the ideal spot (that park could have had a pull-up bar but the people in charge decided it was not a good idea, something I think is quite dumb but oh well).

Here is where I did most of my training, which focused on the calisthenics side of the workout.

Luckily for me though, I managed to find some small weights lying around at home, so not all was lost when it came to gym training. Granted, it wasn't ideal at all, especially for chest where I need much larger weights, but for the shoulders and triceps, they did the job.

# Wrapping up

Overall it was a week of small changes, some adaptations, and a bit of relaxation in between. It wasn't great for development (even though now I am at max reps for all calisthenic exercises, ready to upgrade), but I needed some of the rest to recover from a strenuous semester at university. Now I am fully charged and ready to go off for the next 4 months, and I feel great. So let's get to it!
