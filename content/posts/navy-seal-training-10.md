During this week I must say that I was totally high on life.

I had a blast all week, managed to get a whole lot of work done, and even got to make an incredible trip along the way.

It was certainly exhausting, but it was one of the best weeks of this year.

But on the downside, in the middle of all this, I realized that I had forgotten something. To work out!

# A filled week

Monday started strong from the get-go. I went to the gym as planned, had classes in the morning, and even had time to go shopping afterward. And all this in the morning. During the afternoon, I studied hard, improved on some projects, and relaxed for a bit. At night, I went out with some friends. That's where the problems started.

Although it was really fun to spend the night with them and those moments are special, when I came home it was super late and I needed to sleep. This meant that I wouldn't be waking up at 6 A.M to work out as usual. I slept in to not be exhausted and woke up when it was time for class.

Two of the seven days had passed, and I already missed one day. According to my recently signed contract, I now had to go every single other day.

## Wednesday my beloved

Wednesday was probably one of the best university days I had all semester, so far.

The first thing I did when I woke up was honor my contract and smashing my workout. I was extra motivated because I didn't want to lose to my contract. After that, classes went great, and I made a lot of progress on my projects. But after that came the best part. And that part was Praxe.

I am not going to get into too much detail about what Praxe is or my thoughts about it, because I believe that everyone should experience it for themselves and form their own opinion. I love it and think it is one of the best experiences one could get from university, but not everyone has the same opinion and it is indeed a heated topic. Maybe one day I can even write about it.

Either way, during this Praxe, I met up with friends from all years, we had lunch together, and after that, we got on the Subway headed to the "Baixa" region of Porto. Usually, the first-year students aren't responsible for doing things, and they only enjoy the moments we prepare for them. For this day, we made them a "treasure hunt" (more like geocaching) across the city.

First, we went to the "Trindade" fountain, where we hid the first of many rewards, went down the "Aliados" and made our way into the "SÃ©" Cathedral, the second location. We went to explore those areas, talking, having fun and everything. It was incredible.

Then we crossed the bridge into Gaia, relaxed for a bit, and even had time to take a few pictures. It was a really great time. Afterward, we had one more surprise for them, which was riding a boat across the Douro river!

We spent all afternoon together, and we were all hyped for it. In the end, we all had dinner together. Well, almost all.

I and some of my friends there went to another dinner that we had already agreed to go to, which made its way well into the night. When I got home it was once again way too late, which as you can probably guess meant I didn't wake up early enough for my workout.

## Trying to comeback

I had missed my contract because of all the partying. It was surely not motivating, and it did make me a bit sad since it meant that I went out too much. But it gave me the motivation to go all out on those other days, to try and make up for what I did.

Friday and Saturday I gave my all, and by the end of the week, I was just as tired as any other week. It didn't feel bad anymore. The contract had done its job, giving me the motivation to keep on working.

# Wrapping up

Even though I failed what I signed on paper that I would be committed to doing, it was for sort of valid reasons, and instead, I made memories that will for sure mark my time at this university. It was the first time we had an experience like that, and it is one I will cherish for a long time. To all of those who made it possible, a big word of appreciation.

And now talking to me, even though you failed, you also won. You know you can't keep going like that, so keep trying to compromise on certain aspects and be more balanced everywhere possible. Future you will thank you. Now keep being better every day!
