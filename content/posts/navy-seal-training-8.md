As I look back into this week, I can clearly see that it was destined for failure from the get go.

Although this time I had brought everything and felt prepared for the rest of the day, it quickly became quite overwhelming.

# Busy scheduling

Monday was still an easy day, just like every other day. I woke up early, did my full work out quite relaxed knowing I have an extra 30 minutes, and headed to class. During the afternoon, I pretty much had a free day after a small meeting and studying.

The problem came around with every single other day, where it seemed like I couldn't catch a break.

Tuesday I had my evening really busy, I still worked out but came home exhausted. Wednesday the same thing happened, and even though I had one of the best nights ever at university, it wasn't good for my recover, and I ended up sleeping only around 3h that night.

After that, I had a day full of classes where I struggled not to fall asleep, and at night off we go to another party, sleeping not much more that night as well.

# Crashing, then burning

And you may ask. How many times did I end up working out that week? 3 times. Only 3 times.

That meant that only on the second week of starting my new contract I had already broken it, which was quite the bummer. Nevertheless, I payed my "fine", which in this case was literally giving Daniela some money for her to spend, and rethought how I organize my days.

Also, on Monday, I got a real eye opener from two friends of mine who I admire a lot. They said that even though I was there, I was not really present and focused on things, not really living the full experience.

At the time it was rough to take it, as I thought I had worked really hard to just be there, and thought that everything else would follow naturally. It didn't. I needed to actually work on being present as well, not just hope it would happen.

It really made me sad and I started to rethink about all I had done working up to that point. Being quite a neurotic person as well, it isn't easy to focus for too long. But I had to try. I knew it would one day pay off.

# Wrapping up

So even though this week I had one of the best nights ever, I also got one of the most shockingly eye opening ones, that gave me the reality check I think I needed. I hope I can prove those friends wrong in the coming future.

Also, as I struggled to find a way to move on, I came across a little poem that led me in the right tracks once again.

It is called Invictus, which is Latin for "unconquerable", and it made me think how in life, nothing good will ever come without my work, and the power is in me to overcome everything bad the world comes at me. After reading and re-reading it that Monday night, I really felt that no matter how much of life may try to put me down, I am the master of my fate, and I am the captain of my soul. Have a great week guys.
