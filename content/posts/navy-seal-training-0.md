Navy SEALs are tough people, there's no doubt about it.

From David Goggins to Jocko Willink and all others, they can inspire everyone to become a better version of themselves. And that's exactly what they did to me. I come from Portugal, but for a period of my life around the time I was 11 and really dreamy, I was convinced I would join the SEALs, breeze through training and be a part of the elite, jumping from airplanes in enemy territory and going on crazy missions around the world, just like in the movies. That lasted until about the time I found I needed U.S citizenship and good eyesight, two things which I, sadly, lacked.

# Why be like a Navy Seal?

Whilst the dream of becoming one quickly disappeared, the admiration for what they did persisted. I saw a documentary that showed what they went through bootcamp and the infamous Hell Week, the physical and mental beating they took and the way they move on either way, it was amazing to see just what hard work can accomplish. Also, they were insanely physically fit. They where an example of a life with training not only of the body, but of the mind as well, having achieved _mens sana in corpore sano_ (a healthy mind in a healthy body). Me, being the short and skinny teenager that I was back then, wished to one day be like that, and saw it as something that if they could do, so could I.

And so, a few years later, I set out to do just that.

# How to train to be a Navy Seal

I didn't come to this as an absolute beginner. For about a year I had trained casually and for a while even went to the gym, so I had at least some minimal physical form. Still, nothing could prepare me for what was ahead.

## Week 0 - The planning

The training consisted of a 26-week plan, where each week I would be training 6 times, Monday to Saturday. Every training includes a form of cardio, in the form of either running or swimming, and some weight-training to go with it. Here's how it goes:

### Cardio

Cardio would be divided into 3 sections, differing in intensity and length of training. They are:

- Long Slow Distance (LSD) training, where you run/swim for a long distance at a slower, but steady pace.
- Continuous High Intensity (CHI), where you run/swim for a short distance at a very high intensity.
- Interval training, where you combine the two methods above to create changes in pace and intensity in a controlled fashion.

Mondays would be for LSD running, Wednesdays for Interval and Fridays for CHI. Then there came swimming, and that's where the problems began. I don't have a swimming pool I can attend. Sadly, I would not be able to develop my swimming during the course of the training. Whilst I do appreciate the extra rest that I get on those days, it would be fun to complete the entire "challenge". But still, I had running, which was hard enough already for someone who sits on a chair all day.

### Calisthenics

The military aren't big on gyms. If you can drop down and give me 20 then why wouldn't you? It is great exercise and best of all, its free. For a college student like me that makes instantly sounds super appealing.

As such, for the most part, the major calisthenics exercises performed were the humble push-up, pull-up and sit-up combo. While it may seem easy, doing 50 push-ups and 50 sit-ups after doing 15 pull-ups is a lot harder than you may think (if you have doubts go ahead and try it). It was great that the training was based on these exercises, because that meant i could perform the majority of them at home. Sadly, I also had no pull-up bar near me, but for that I had a gym to go to. Why go to a gym if you only intended to do calisthenics?

### Strength Training

For SEALs, doing only calisthenics isn't enough. Whilst a training like that can give a lot of benefits, for sheer strength gains, there is nothing like isolated machine and weight work
