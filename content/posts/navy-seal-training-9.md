I have to be honest, I have been slacking off a lot on my writing.

I don't judge myself, my schedule has been a little chaotic lately and I have been having my priorities a little mixed up, and just not enough time to sit down and do some focused thinking that wasn't for work.

Most of my days were either spent focusing on keeping up with university work, which for a few days became pretty overwhelming, and handling other activies I do, which if they get out of control can take over all your time. And sometimes they did.

That's why I decided to take it a bit easy and start establishing priorities. I would step back a bit from those activities and try to fully enjoy them, but in moderation. When I am there, I am present and enjoying the most of the moment. Otherwise, I would be better of focusing on university, going to the gym, or even in writing.

# Needing to prioritize

When talking to a few of my friends about all that I like to do, I realized that 24 hours in a day are simply not enough to do everything I want and still find time to rest properly.

Between working out, university, being with my girlfriend, reading, writing and being present in Praxe (an academic tradition from Portugal), and many other things I like to do, it is simply not enough to delegate and timeblock, if I want to enjoy all of them fully. So instead I make compromises.

Every week I define what are the most important things to do. Normally, it is a combination of university, Praxe, being with my girlfriend and working, as I consider these the biggest pillars of my life. Then, I try to make time for all other things whenever possible.

Usually, I try to read in the more dull moments, and write in the weekends where I have more continuous free time. Also, in the weekends, I make it a priority to be with my girlfriend, to compensate for all the time I have been distant during the week.

The system is not ideal, but it does become effective when you commit to it, and as I use it more and more, I get better at estimating times and delegating even better.

# Speaking of working out

But I digress, this was supposed to be a progress journal for my workouts. Contrary to what might be expected, I actually worked out really well this week. I remained pretty consistent, only missing Saturday because I was at my girlfriends house, but made steady progress in all exercise categories.

Also, I became really close to hitting one of my major milestones, getting to 100 push-ups in a workout. I am already up to 90, but I believe I can progress steadily, and by next week hit my milestone.

Now that I am bulking up I should also try to lift a lot heavier, and maybe reduce the number of reps a bit, to try and reach overload on the weights and increase them consistently. Overall I am liking the progress a lot.

Also, it is pretty cool to see it in action, looking back at the weights with which I started out and what I am up to now, it feels Nice. Also, I have noticed that they have become a little boring as of late, maybe I should try to mix them up a bit, like I did with my core training, to make it interesting again.

# Wrapping up

This idea to start this workout has been one of the best I ever decided to embark on. Even though it feels like it is just starting out, I am almost half-way through my journey, and seeing the progress I have been doing, it seems amazing. Hopefully, when it is all over, I can start yet another one that will be even more demanding, challenging, but will allow me to be much more successful.

I have been working out seriously for around a year and a half now, and I am really proud of what I am becoming. Keep up with this every day, and let the progress speak for itself. Let's get to it!
