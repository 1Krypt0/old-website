This is the story of the best gift I ever received, and one of the best I probably will ever receive.

## The Origin Story

It all started when I turned 18. It is always a special occasion, and with me being born late in December, it was even more exciting after seeing all of my friends having their great parties and moments.

That year was also the year I started dating Daniela, so it was even better as it was my first birthday I would spend with a "special someone", something every teen would love to have.

But the best thing to come out of that day was not the party, it was not the amazing food that my parents made, it was much greater than that. It was cleanup time after all the guests were gone, and in a quite unusual fashion my father called me to talk. I arrived in the kitchen and both of my parents said, much like the Apple keynotes, that "there is one more thing".

At that moment they reveal that I have one more gift, from them, and that it was the chance to go to London for half a week, with 1 other person that I would wish to come with me. I didn't even know what to say. I was shocked at what was offered and didn't really understand what they told me (at first I even thought they were joking), but it was real, I could go to London, one of my favorite places in the world, with whoever I want. This was incredible.

Obviously I told them yes, and right after that I asked them if it was ok if I took Daniela with me, to which they said they were already expecting that answer, and were more than fine with me going with her. This was one of the best feelings possible. Knowing that I can travel to one of the best cities in the world with my girlfriend, it was such an amazing thing. I immediately told her, and as soon as she got confirmation from her parents a few days after, we started planning.

## Setting the Plan

Since we were going for essentially 3 days, we wanted to see as much as possible in the short time we had there. That meant we needed a solid itinerary that would take us to the most important things, seeing what we both wanted and wasting as little time as possible in transportation, while still feeling like a relaxed yet fast-paced journey. Also, since it was quite the expensive gift, and I didn't want to spend any more money, we also took into account the prices of things and chose the cheapest options for everything, which is actually quite fun.

All the planning really got both of us even more hyped to go, and looking at the different ways we could visit and go to places made us find even more special things and places to add to the trip.

With countless nights seeing the possible visiting destinations, estimating prices and finding the fastest routes that didn't break the bank, we finally had a detailed plan on how to have the most amazing journey possible. In the end, it looked something like this:
