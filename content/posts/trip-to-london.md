This is the story of the best gift I ever received, and one of the best I probably will ever receive.

## The Origin Story

It all started when I turned 18. It is always a special occasion, and with me being born late in December, it was even more exciting after seeing all of my friends having their great parties and moments.

That year was also the year I started dating Daniela, so it was even better as it was my first birthday I would spend with a "special someone", something every teen would love to have.

But the best thing to come out of that day was not the party, it was not the amazing food that my parents made, it was much greater than that. It was cleanup time after all the guests were gone, and in a quite unusual fashion my father called me to talk. I arrived in the kitchen and both of my parents said, much like the Apple keynotes, that "there is one more thing".

At that moment they reveal that I have one more gift, from them, and that it was the chance to go to London for half a week, with 1 other person that I would wish to come with me. I didn't even know what to say. I was shocked at what was offered and didn't really understand what they told me (at first I even thought they were joking), but it was real, I could go to London, one of my favorite places in the world, with whoever I want. This was incredible.

Obviously I told them yes, and right after that I asked them if it was ok if I took Daniela with me, to which they said they were already expecting that answer, and were more than fine with me going with her. This was one of the best feelings possible. Knowing that I can travel to one of the best cities in the world with my girlfriend, it was such an amazing thing. I immediately told her, and as soon as she got confirmation from her parents a few days after, we started planning.

## Setting the Plan

Since we were going for essentially 3 days, we wanted to see as much as possible in the short time we had there. That meant we needed a solid itinerary that would take us to the most important things, seeing what we both wanted and wasting as little time as possible in transportation, while still feeling like a relaxed yet fast-paced journey. Also, since it was quite the expensive gift, and I didn't want to spend any more money, we also took into account the prices of things and chose the cheapest options for everything, which is actually quite fun.

All the planning really got both of us even more hyped to go, and looking at the different ways we could visit and go to places made us find even more special things and places to add to the trip.

With countless nights seeing the possible visiting destinations, estimating prices and finding the fastest routes that didn't break the bank, we finally had a detailed plan on how to have the most amazing journey possible. In the end, it looked something like this:

## Day 1: The Arrival

Our flight was at around 6 A.M, which means that at around 3:30 I was already awake and getting ready to leave. That night I barely slept, and not for lack of trying. Daniela tried and actually did sleep. She is lucky in that aspect. But neither of us cared even if we didn't sleep at all. We were so excited it kept us wide awake. We arrived at the airport, all still pitch black outside, I gave the goodbye to my parents and so we went to board. I never had gone to an airport alone like that. All the sudden it felt like I really was an adult, with responsibilities. Its scary, but the freedom you get at the same time is incredible. I was kind of in shock all that time, like it didn't feel real. But it was. I really was going to London with my girlfriend.

Check-in complete, shops visited and all of the sudden we were boarding the plane. At that moment I found out my godfather (who is my cousin) and his wife were going in the exact same journey as us. It was fun hanging out with them, and knowing that after all I wasn't completely alone in London, in case something happenned.

This is me boarding the plane, still a bit flabbergasted about going.

The flight took off, and the journey was well under way. The time in the air is really good to actually calm down and actually let the body relax. So we did. We talked, played games, and tried to prepare for what was coming. But nothing could prepare us for how amazing everything would get in a bit.

We arrived at 9 A.M, and were instantly met by the freezing cold of being so far up north. It was freezing the entire journey. But it felt good. We walked around in heavy jackets all the time and not for one moment were we cold or sweating, something that happens after 20 minutes in Portugal. It was amazing. And so the journey began. We went through the massive building that is Stansted airport, figured out where the train was, and off we were into the heart of London, Liverpool Street Station.

When we got there, we knew exactly what to do. We had planned all this. It felt so good to have that plan, so we didn't feel overwhelmed at all. But still, we were. We had made it to one of the coolest cities in the world!

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/subway.jpg" alt="The London subway in all its glory" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We got off at our first stop, Queensway, and went straight to the hotel we were going to stay. It was small, but cozy. For the time we would spend there, it was more than enough.

Check-in done, we suddenly realized something. We hadn't eaten since like 4 A.M and it was already midday. So we found a cheap place to eat, and we weren't disappointed.

Now, the exploring began. Since we were going to be quite sleep deprived, there were 3 main places to visit in day 1:

- Hyde Park
- The Natural History Museum
- Harrods department store

Right after we had eaten, we went to a little store to buy some supplies a.k.a food and water for whenever we got hungry while travelling.

#### Hyde Park

Our first real sight was London's biggest park, Hyde Park. It always seemed huge in the map, but only when we actually entered it to cross did we realize just how huge it is. It seemed to stretch forever, and it was full of trees, lakes, animals, everything. It really seemed a happy place, and we loved to go the lake where there were a ton of swans, ducks and whatnot, just because we had never seen nothing as big as that. We stopped to admire the magnitude of it all, the animals all around the lake, and we went on with our journey.

Just to go across the park it seemed like a massive journey, and we went through the short side!

Also at this point we were starting to realize something. We would be walking a lot. Like 20km a day a lot. None of us had the kind of feet for that. This was getting evident when, just as we where getting out of Hyde Park, my feet started getting a little sore. This would become a recurring event in the coming days. But at that point, it was quite manageable, and wasn't all that bad, for the moment.

So out we went, and the first of the many amazing places was officially checked off the list.

#### Natural History Museum

Next stop, the magic Natural History Museum.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/nat-hist-entrance.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Natural History Museum" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I had seen pictures of this place before. But nothing could prepare me for what was in front of me at this moment. It was so big!

I always loved these sorts of museums, but none of the ones I had seen looked as giant as this one. Just entering and being immediately greeted by the huge whale skeleton is breathtaking, and sets you up for a whole afternoon of entertainment.

Right after you walk through this massive entrance, you are greeted with this:

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/whale.jpg" alt="The giant whale skeleton at the entrance" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Behind it sits a statue of the great Charles Darwin, a great symbol for all that was found inside this museum.

Inside the massive corridors sit a million different exhibits showcasing everything from dinosaur fossils and models, all the animal kingdoms showed in all their glory, the life of the giant sequoia trees to the history of the earth itself. Anything that was an important part of the Earth, you can find a piece of it here.

Needless to say, me and Daniela were totally starstruck. Me especially, having spend a lot of my childhood seeing things like these on TV, finally seeing them in real life was an experience I can never forget. We spent around 3 hours here, and it all seemed to just fly by.

The only thing that grounded us a bit and started to take its toll were our feet. Inside the museum we walked through every single surface possible and it showed. We must have done a few kilometers in there, not stopping for a bit. In the end they were really hurting and the lack of sleep really started to show a lot. We were getting exhausted. But we pushed on, as we had just one more thing to see...

#### Harrods

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/harrods-entry.jpg" alt="The entry to Harrods" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

By this point we were a total wreck.

After walking quite a bit to get here, our feet were completely dead, the sleep was making us really slow and also, we developed a bit of a hunger. Needless to say, it was not as fun to visit as we had hoped. At least it was the thing we least felt the need to visit in the whole trip, so not taking it in fully wasn't the end of the world. We would've been much sadder if this happenned in the Natural History Museum.

One thing that was quite the sight to see was the architecture of the buildings around it. Everything seemed just so fancy and expensive, like it was made for royalty. Just after going there I found out we were actually just a few meters away from some of the most expensive apartments in the whole world, so we were in the middle of real money.

In the store, there were booths for Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Versace and all that you can imagine. For us, it was something we had never seen. The butcher and pastries sections were so beautiful, like everything inside it. But we made our visit fast, so our feet would stop hurting so much.

#### Winding down for the day

After we went out, we stopped at a nearby Starbucks just to rest the feet and stop for a bit, after hours and hours of non stop walking and standing up. It felt really nice to just relax for a few minutes. We figured out where to have dinner, and chose to try out the infamous "cheeky Nando's".

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/nandos.jpg" alt="Our dinner at Nandos" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It was definitely not bad, but coming from the country where that food is super popular (the logo even is the symbol of our hometown, the "Galo de Barcelos"), it could have been a bit better. But still, it was quite the treat after all that walking.

After this, we were completely exhausted as we got to the hotel. We arrived, showered, got into bed, and almost passed out immediately. It was an amazing day. But we had to rest as the next one would be even bigger.

## Day 2: Exploring around London

The second day was going to be the biggest one. It was the first full day we would have to explore and so we needed to take advantage of it. The plan had us travelling north, starting from the Thames and ending in the big center of London, Picadilly Circus.

Through it we would pass by:

- Buckingham Palace
- Westminster Abbey
- The Houses of Parliament
- Big Ben
- Chinatown
- The British Museum
- Oxford Street
- Picadilly Circus

And more. Yeah, it was packed.

We woke up early in the morning, after a not so good nights sleep because of all the heat that was blasting from the radiator we didn't know how to control, and the freezing cold of the window we opened to fight it. We had our breakfast, eating a lot to have energy for the day, and try to cure the lingering pain to our feet, and off we went.

First stop, the Royal House.

#### Buckingham Palace

We got off the subway and we knew right away we were in the right place. The massive royal building, the beautiful black and gold gates, the red guards everywhere, it was quite the sight to see.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/buckingham.jpg" alt="A shot of Buckingham Palace" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 10px" >}}

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/gates.jpg" alt="A side gate to one of the gardens" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The best part was the fact that right after we got there, the sun started shining and illuminating everything making the buildings seem even more powerful.

Everything around that area seemed superbly clean and organized, and since it was mostly empty (at least compared to a lot of the places we had been through so far), we could have more liberty to explore. Just imagining that inside those walls lives an actual Queen, and we were so close to actual royalty is really cool.

We really wanted to stay for the change of guard with all the ceremony, but we had to move on with the plan. Not without snapping a few pics before going tho. Just look at this one, Daniela looks amazing!

#### Trafalgar Square

#### British Museum

#### Picadilly Circus
