This is the story of the best gift I ever received, and one of the best I probably will ever receive.

## The Origin Story

It all started when I turned 18. It is always a special occasion, and with me being born late in December, it was even more exciting after seeing all of my friends having their great parties and moments.

That year was also the year I started dating Daniela, so it was even better as it was my first birthday I would spend with a "special someone", something every teen would love to have.

But the best thing to come out of that day was not the party, it was not the amazing food that my parents made, it was much greater than that. It was cleanup time after all the guests were gone, and in a quite unusual fashion my father called me to talk. I arrived in the kitchen and both of my parents said, much like the Apple keynotes, that "there is one more thing".

At that moment they reveal that I have one more gift, from them, and that it was the chance to go to London for half a week, with 1 other person that I would wish to come with me. I didn't even know what to say. I was shocked at what was offered and didn't really understand what they told me (at first I even thought they were joking), but it was real, I could go to London, one of my favorite places in the world, with whoever I want. This was incredible.

Obviously I told them yes, and right after that I asked them if it was ok if I took Daniela with me, to which they said they were already expecting that answer, and were more than fine with me going with her. This was one of the best feelings possible. Knowing that I can travel to one of the best cities in the world with my girlfriend, it was such an amazing thing. I immediately told her, and as soon as she got confirmation from her parents a few days after, we started planning.

## Setting the Plan

Since we were going for essentially 3 days, we wanted to see as much as possible in the short time we had there. That meant we needed a solid itinerary that would take us to the most important things, seeing what we both wanted and wasting as little time as possible in transportation, while still feeling like a relaxed yet fast-paced journey. Also, since it was quite the expensive gift, and I didn't want to spend any more money, we also took into account the prices of things and chose the cheapest options for everything, which is actually quite fun.

All the planning really got both of us even more hyped to go, and looking at the different ways we could visit and go to places made us find even more special things and places to add to the trip.

With countless nights seeing the possible visiting destinations, estimating prices and finding the fastest routes that didn't break the bank, we finally had a detailed plan on how to have the most amazing journey possible. In the end, it looked something like this:

## Day 1: The Arrival

Our flight was at around 6 A.M, which means that at around 3:30 I was already awake and getting ready to leave. That night I barely slept, and not for lack of trying. Daniela tried and actually did sleep. She is lucky in that aspect. But neither of us cared even if we didn't sleep at all. We were so excited it kept us wide awake. We arrived at the airport, all still pitch black outside, I gave the goodbye to my parents and so we went to board. I never had gone to an airport alone like that. All the sudden it felt like I really was an adult, with responsibilities. Its scary, but the freedom you get at the same time is incredible. I was kind of in shock all that time, like it didn't feel real. But it was. I really was going to London with my girlfriend.

Check-in complete, shops visited and all of the sudden we were boarding the plane. At that moment I found out my godfather (who is my cousin) and his wife were going in the exact same journey as us. It was fun hanging out with them, and knowing that after all I wasn't completely alone in London, in case something happenned.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/departure.jpg" alt="Me boarding the plane" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

This is me boarding the plane, still a bit flabbergasted about going.

The flight took off, and the journey was well under way. The time in the air is really good to actually calm down and actually let the body relax. So we did. We talked, played games, and tried to prepare for what was coming. But nothing could prepare us for how amazing everything would get in a bit.

We arrived at 9 A.M, and were instantly met by the freezing cold of being so far up north. It was freezing the entire journey. But it felt good. We walked around in heavy jackets all the time and not for one moment were we cold or sweating, something that happens after 20 minutes in Portugal. It was amazing. And so the journey began. We went through the massive building that is Stansted airport, figured out where the train was, and off we were into the heart of London, Liverpool Street Station.

When we got there, we knew exactly what to do. We had planned all this. It felt so good to have that plan, so we didn't feel overwhelmed at all. But still, we were. We had made it to one of the coolest cities in the world!

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/subway.jpg" alt="The London subway in all its glory" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We got off at our first stop, Queensway, and went straight to the hotel we were going to stay. It was small, but cozy. For the time we would spend there, it was more than enough.

Check-in done, we suddenly realized something. We hadn't eaten since like 4 A.M and it was already midday. So we found a cheap place to eat, and we weren't disappointed.

Now, the exploring began. Since we were going to be quite sleep deprived, there were 3 main places to visit in day 1:

- Hyde Park
- The Natural History Museum
- Harrods department store

Right after we had eaten, we went to a little store to buy some supplies a.k.a food and water for whenever we got hungry while travelling.

#### Hyde Park

Our first real sight was London's biggest park, Hyde Park. It always seemed huge in the map, but only when we actually entered it to cross did we realize just how huge it is. It seemed to stretch forever, and it was full of trees, lakes, animals, everything. It really seemed a happy place, and we loved to go the lake where there were a ton of swans, ducks and whatnot, just because we had never seen nothing as big as that. We stopped to admire the magnitude of it all, the animals all around the lake, and we went on with our journey.

Just to go across the park it seemed like a massive journey, and we went through the short side!

Also at this point we were starting to realize something. We would be walking a lot. Like 20km a day a lot. None of us had the kind of feet for that. This was getting evident when, just as we where getting out of Hyde Park, my feet started getting a little sore. This would become a recurring event in the coming days. But at that point, it was quite manageable, and wasn't all that bad, for the moment.

So out we went, and the first of the many amazing places was officially checked off the list.

#### Natural History Museum

Next stop, the magic Natural History Museum.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/nat-hist-entrance.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Natural History Museum" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I had seen pictures of this place before. But nothing could prepare me for what was in front of me at this moment. It was so big!

I always loved these sorts of museums, but none of the ones I had seen looked as giant as this one. Just entering and being immediately greeted by the huge whale skeleton is breathtaking, and sets you up for a whole afternoon of entertainment.

Right after you walk through this massive entrance, you are greeted with this:

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/whale.jpg" alt="The giant whale skeleton at the entrance" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Behind it sits a statue of the great Charles Darwin, a great symbol for all that was found inside this museum.

Inside the massive corridors sit a million different exhibits showcasing everything from dinosaur fossils and models, all the animal kingdoms showed in all their glory, the life of the giant sequoia trees to the history of the earth itself. Anything that was an important part of the Earth, you can find a piece of it here.

Needless to say, me and Daniela were totally starstruck. Me especially, having spend a lot of my childhood seeing things like these on TV, finally seeing them in real life was an experience I can never forget. We spent around 3 hours here, and it all seemed to just fly by.

The only thing that grounded us a bit and started to take its toll were our feet. Inside the museum we walked through every single surface possible and it showed. We must have done a few kilometers in there, not stopping for a bit. In the end they were really hurting and the lack of sleep really started to show a lot. We were getting exhausted. But we pushed on, as we had just one more thing to see...

#### Harrods

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/harrods-entry.jpg" alt="The entry to Harrods" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

By this point we were a total wreck.

After walking quite a bit to get here, our feet were completely dead, the sleep was making us really slow and also, we developed a bit of a hunger. Needless to say, it was not as fun to visit as we had hoped. At least it was the thing we least felt the need to visit in the whole trip, so not taking it in fully wasn't the end of the world. We would've been much sadder if this happenned in the Natural History Museum.

One thing that was quite the sight to see was the architecture of the buildings around it. Everything seemed just so fancy and expensive, like it was made for royalty. Just after going there I found out we were actually just a few meters away from some of the most expensive apartments in the whole world, so we were in the middle of real money.

In the store, there were booths for Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Versace and all that you can imagine. For us, it was something we had never seen. The butcher and pastries sections were so beautiful, like everything inside it. But we made our visit fast, so our feet would stop hurting so much.

#### Winding down for the day

After we went out, we stopped at a nearby Starbucks just to rest the feet and stop for a bit, after hours and hours of non stop walking and standing up. It felt really nice to just relax for a few minutes. We figured out where to have dinner, and chose to try out the infamous "cheeky Nando's".

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/nandos.jpg" alt="Our dinner at Nandos" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It was definitely not bad, but coming from the country where that food is super popular (the logo even is the symbol of our hometown, the "Galo de Barcelos"), it could have been a bit better. But still, it was quite the treat after all that walking.

After this, we were completely exhausted as we got to the hotel. We arrived, showered, got into bed, and almost passed out immediately. It was an amazing day. But we had to rest as the next one would be even bigger.

## Day 2: Exploring around London

The second day was going to be the biggest one. It was the first full day we would have to explore and so we needed to take advantage of it. The plan had us travelling north, starting from the Thames and ending in the big center of London, Picadilly Circus.

Through it we would pass by:

- Buckingham Palace
- Westminster Abbey
- The Houses of Parliament
- Big Ben
- Chinatown
- The British Museum
- Oxford Street
- Picadilly Circus

And more. Yeah, it was packed.

We woke up early in the morning, after a not so good nights sleep because of all the heat that was blasting from the radiator we didn't know how to control, and the freezing cold of the window we opened to fight it. We had our breakfast, eating a lot to have energy for the day, and try to cure the lingering pain to our feet, and off we went.

First stop, the Royal House.

#### Buckingham Palace

We got off the subway and we knew right away we were in the right place. The massive royal building, the beautiful black and gold gates, the red guards everywhere, it was quite the sight to see.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/buckingham.jpg" alt="A shot of Buckingham Palace" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 10px" >}}

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/gates.jpg" alt="A side gate to one of the gardens" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The best part was the fact that right after we got there, the sun started shining and illuminating everything making the buildings seem even more powerful.

Everything around that area seemed superbly clean and organized, and since it was mostly empty (at least compared to a lot of the places we had been through so far), we could have more liberty to explore. Just imagining that inside those walls lives an actual Queen, and we were so close to actual royalty is really cool.

We really wanted to stay for the change of guard with all the ceremony, but we had to move on with the plan. Not without snapping a few pics before going tho. Just look at this one, Daniela looks amazing!

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/daniela-buckingham.jpg" alt="A picture of Daniela next to Buckingham Palace" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Next stop, the riverside!

#### Westminster Abbey

Funny story, I am really bad at figuring out which important building is which. When in a city where every building seems important like in London, this conditions worsens, tremendously. This effect was shown quite well when we were walking to try and find Westminster Abbey, walking just by it, totally ignoring thinking it is just any other church, looking for "the real Westminster Abbey", wasting nearly half an hour or more until I figured out we had just passed by it.

At one point, I was convinced the houses of Parliament where what we were looking for, until the absurd amount of police guarding the entrance made me think that maybe that wasn't it.

When Daniela made me realize it, she first mocked me, and kept doing so for the next day, and then we actually got into the Abbey.

Seeing the resting place of legends I have always admired like Sir Isaac Newton, Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, it really felt like standing in the shoulders of giants. The Scientist's Corner really was the part I most admired, but seeing names like Charles Dickens in there, or the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, which was kept pristine at all times, made us realize we were in the middle of greatness there.

We couldn't take any pictures while inside, but those halls, we will never forget.

#### Houses of Parliament and the Big Ben

Down we went closer to the Thames, where we saw the world famous London Eye, and had to control ourselves deeply to not go on a ride (the queue was massive and we wouldn't have time for anything else). So we just lounged around the area of the mighty Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, took a few more pictures of the amazing buildings, and went with our way.

Here the most surprising thing that happenned was when we went to a Tesco to fill up on snacks for the day, it was just so tiny! The whole shop was barely the size of a corridor, and two people could not fit inside when looking for things. I had never seen anything like it before, we were both quite shocked. But we had our food, so everything was ok.

#### Trafalgar Square

After this our path up through London began, and the first stop was the gigantic Trafalgar Square. It was full of life, with people travelling everywhere and many of them visiting the famous National Gallery, which we sadly didn't go to. But once again the sun was shining, so we took some more pictures, this time I am the one that looks quite nice, just look:

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/tiago-trafalgar.jpg" alt="A picture of me next to the National Gallery" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It really was a cool place to be. But by this time, we had developed quite the appetite. So off we went to search for our lunch. The first thing we encountered was Chinatown, vibrant as ever and it looked like a super cool place to have lunch. Sadly, Daniela didn't find any of them appetizing enough, so I had another idea, to try out the classic British delicacy that is fish and chips!

Sadly, it was one of the big letdowns of the journey. For the time we waited and the price we paid, it is clear that it was a tourist trap above all else. But at least I can't say I didn't try it, however disappointing it may have been. It was also the first time any of us had fresh cod, since in Portugal almost all of it is salted to be preserved. I hate salted cod, but the fresh one was really good for a change. We should invest in it more.

#### British Museum

After relaxing a bit in the restaurant and letting our feet heal for a moment, we went to our last big destination for the day, the mighty British Museum. As we got there, there we started to realize its magnitude, but boy were we in for a treat.

The entrance alone is one of the most beautiful museum entrances I have seen (even after entering the Natural History one), and the architecture inside is so beautiful.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/british-entrance.jpg" alt="The ceiling on the entrance of the British Museum" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

You are met with this huge glass ceiling that sits above the entire room, creating a mood lighting like no other. On each of the other 3 sides, there is a massive hallway that will take you through a journey through different periods of history. Unlike the Natural History Museum, this one is focused on humans, and our history throughout the world. From the Greeks and Romans, the ancient oriental World, the mighty Egypt and its famous Rosetta Stone, everything about human history and more could be found in this walls.

Each corner of the museum left me more amazed than the previous, with rooms for absolutely everything. It was fascinating seeing some of the pieces they have collected over the years, and the history each one tells. It was yet another experience I will never forget. But, being honest, if I had to choose between this and the Natural History Museum, I would favor the latter (I love animals, sue me). Daniela prefers this one, and that is why we visited both.

After around 4 hours of non-stop exploring this place, we were absolutely decimated by our feet. We stopped on some stairs by the bar and chilled around for some time, as on the second day our feet were really really hurt. Daniela suffered even more, as her shoes provided little support, so she really needed that rest.

After both of us feeling better, it was already dark outside, so it was time for some big treats.

#### Picadilly Circus

When we got out it was super dark, which was the perfect setting for our final destinations. First stop, getting the now world famous Bubblewrap. We had seen it on a Youtube video, and since we were close we decided to give it a try. The result speaks for itself:

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/bubblewrap.jpg" alt="A bubblewrap waffle in Chinatown" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It was delicious, and even made us forget how much our feet were sore!

After walking a bit down the streets of London, and seeing things we never heard of like a Harry Potter theater, we arrived at the hustle and bustle that is Picadilly Circus.

It was the brightest place I had ever seen at night. The giant screens made it feel like daytime, and the amount of people walking around told us this was the place to be at night in London.

There was music, street performers, tourists and locals everywhere, hanging around this area. It felt like we were a part of the nightlife of London, and we kind of were!

With all the admiration still hitting us, we looked closely and found one of the happiest places on Earth. An M&M store! Obviously we had to visit it, not only to see for ourselves, but also to get a lot of free candy.

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/candy-shop.jpg" alt="Some of the dispensers in the candy store" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We came out very very happy, but even more so when we found out the fun wasn't over, because just across the street in Leicester Square there was a huge Lego store!

{{< image src="/trip-to-london/lego.jpg" alt="A Lego Replica of the Subway train" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We both are huge fans of Lego's, and seeing what they built here made us feel like children again. Needless to say this was one of the best nights of my life.

After it started getting late, and our feet just couldn't take it anymore, we went back to the hotel, already limping and crawlong at this point (or so it seemed), we lied in bed, and once again we completely passed out from how tired we were.

This was one of the best days of my life, and the memories I still hold of it show this clearly.
