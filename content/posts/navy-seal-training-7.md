With the semester in full-swing now, I can start planting the seed for a definitive routine for the rest of the year.

The plans that I had started out back in Week 0 could be implemented to their fullest, and I could finally start having the real life I wanted in university, being a T-shaped person (if you haven't heard of that before, [here](https://collegeinfogeek.com/become-t-shaped-person/) is a good article explaining it).

As usual, I came to Porto on Sunday after packing in a rush, and when I got here I didn't even think about what I actually brought, I just offloaded everything and went to rest. This proved to be a fatal mistake.

# Starting poor, then going hard

That night, as I was packing for the next day of classes, I stumbled upon some big issues. I didn't bring with me any towel for the gym, any water bottle, and only a single pair of gym shorts. How did this happen? I have no clue. The hurry of packing makes you forget a lot of stuff indeed.

This also happenned by the time I signed my contract, and so could only skip at most one day of my workout per week. And I was right away forced to skip it on day 1. It made me a bit sad, not gonna lie.

The only upside in all that was the fact that my mom was coming to Porto that day and I asked her in time to bring everything to me.

## Working out at 6 A.M

Everyday for this week, in order to train well, I woke up at 6 A.M, so I could have my gym session before university started. This is actually a great time to train and I absolutely love it, especially knowing that everyone else is asleep and I am already ahead on the day.

The problem is that every night, right after dinner, I become absolutely exhausted and unable to do anything at all. This conditions worsens on busy university days, where there are a lot of classes or things to do, and I find myself just wanting to go to bed super early, but still having to prepare everything for the next day.

Also, at night, I want to spend some time with Daniela, which leads to me staying up until later than I should (not her fault, I procrastinate a lot).

On Monday and Tuesday this was quite tolerable, as I still was well rested from the weekend. But as the tiredness piled on, on Wednesday and especially Thursday, the lack of sleep really started to show.

Needless to say that getting out of bed on those days was nothing short of a miracle.

# The power of rest

This week taught me a valuable lesson. Taking myself to my limit both physically and mentally is a lot more challenging than it seems at first, and without proper recovery, every day you will be more and more sluggish. Every Monday starts out just fine, Tuesday as well, Tuesday night you hit start getting a bit tired, Wednesday morning is a challenge to get up, at Wednesday night you are a wreck and Thursday morning is near impossible.

All of this happens because I am simply not allowing myself to recover for enough time. Given the hours at which I work out and the amount of time I am at the university studying, and other things that I have to be focused for the whole afternoon and sometimes even at night, rest and recovery is essential.

This rest, at least the way I perceive it, is two-fold. First comes the actual physical rest, from all the moving around all day. The cure for that involves a lot more sitting down, and not moving as much when I am done training.

But the mental rest, that is the tricky part. When I spend a whole afternoon studying, I rarely think of taking breaks. When I get into a state of flow, whole hours just fly by and I don't even notice. It is great to be able to do this, and it is a skill that I honed over the years. But it takes its toll. And the result is a completely burnt out Tiago by the end of Thursday.

## What I intend to do

From now on, I will prioritize two things. Sleep and taking breaks. Regarding sleep, I will try to sleep whenever and however much I can. For the longest of times I thought sleeping less would be ideal, but that is clearly not the case (even though I recently discovered I can function decently on anywhere from 2:30 to 4 hours of sleep, although not for long).

Eight full hours per day would be ideal, but 7 of quality sleep I think would suffice. To do this, it is really simple, just go to bed earlier.

And while this also helps with the mental rest, the biggest gain I can think of would be to take more frequent breaks. Every 45 to 50 minutes of work, simply stopping for 10 minutes would give the rest I needed to keep going, I believe. Also, focusing less on studying a lot of time, but studying well when I decide to do so can improve my relationship with rest as well.

# Wrapping up

Overall, while the week was certainly tiring, I feel like I gave it my all, and got out of it a much better person because of it. Maybe next week I will start getting used to this schedule and won't need to improve so drastically. Maybe it will get worse and I will have to take even more breaks. I won't know until I at least give it a try. So on we got with the plan, let's make this next week the best one yet!
