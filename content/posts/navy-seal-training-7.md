With the semester in full-swing now, I can start planting the seed for a definitive routine for the rest of the year.

The plans that I had started out back in Week 0 could be implemented to their fullest, and I could finally start having the real life I wanted in university, being a T-shaped person (if you haven't heard of that before, [here](https://collegeinfogeek.com/become-t-shaped-person/) is a good article explaining it).

As usual, I came to Porto on Sunday after packing in a rush, and when I got here I didn't even think about what I actually brought, I just offloaded everything and went to rest. This proved to be a fatal mistake.

# Starting poor, then going hard

That night, as I was packing for the next day of classes, I stumbled upon some big issues. I didn't bring with me any towel for the gym, any water bottle, and only a single pair of gym shorts. How did this happen? I have no clue. The hurry of packing makes you forget a lot of stuff indeed.

This also happenned by the time I signed my contract, and so could only skip at most one day of my workout per week. And I was right away forced to skip it on day 1. It made me a bit sad, not gonna lie.

The only upside in all that was the fact that my mom was coming to Porto that day and I asked her in time to bring everything to me.
