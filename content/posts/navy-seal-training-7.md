With the semester in full-swing now, I can start planting the seed for a definitive routine for the rest of the year.

The plans that I had started out back in Week 0 could be implemented to their fullest, and I could finally start having the real life I wanted in university, being a T-shaped person (if you haven't heard of that before, [here](https://collegeinfogeek.com/become-t-shaped-person/) is a good article explaining it).

As usual, I came to Porto on Sunday after packing in a rush, and when I got here I didn't even think about what I actually brought, I just offloaded everything and went to rest. This proved to be a fatal mistake.

# Starting poor, then going hard

That night, as I was packing for the next day of classes, I stumbled upon some big issues. I didn't bring with me any towel for the gym, any water bottle, and only a single pair of gym shorts. How did this happen? I have no clue. The hurry of packing makes you forget a lot of stuff indeed.

This also happenned by the time I signed my contract, and so could only skip at most one day of my workout per week. And I was right away forced to skip it on day 1. It made me a bit sad, not gonna lie.

The only upside in all that was the fact that my mom was coming to Porto that day and I asked her in time to bring everything to me.

## Working out at 6 A.M

Everyday for this week, in order to train well, I woke up at 6 A.M, so I could have my gym session before university started. This is actually a great time to train and I absolutely love it, especially knowing that everyone else is asleep and I am already ahead on the day.

The problem is that every night, right after dinner, I become absolutely exhausted and unable to do anything at all. This conditions worsens on busy university days, where there are a lot of classes or things to do, and I find myself just wanting to go to bed super early, but still having to prepare everything for the next day.

Also, at night, I want to spend some time with Daniela, which leads to me staying up until later than I should (not her fault, I procrastinate a lot).

On Monday and Tuesday this was quite tolerable, as I still was well rested from the weekend. But as the tiredness piled on, on Wednesday and especially Thursday, the lack of sleep really started to show.

Needless to say that getting out of bed on those days was nothing short of a miracle.
