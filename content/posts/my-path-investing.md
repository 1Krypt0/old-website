When I was 17, I was an avid fan of a Youtube channel called [Teaching Men's Fashion](https://www.youtube.com/c/Teachingmensfashion), or TMF. It was a style channel, with some self-improvement tips and whatnot. For a dorky teenager like I was, it was a lifesaver (although now I question a lot of my life choices regarding why I even liked that).

Even though the channel was mainly regarding fashion and grooming, in one video they talked about how one of their favorite channels was from a guy called [Graham Stephan](https://www.youtube.com/c/GrahamStephan).

Graham is a real-estate agent and has a Youtube channel where he talks about all sorts of finance-related topics. And he had several videos regarding investing. That was when I found out how investing worked.

## Starting my journey

The moment I started watching his videos, I was hooked. I became really interested in personal finance, budgeting, and most of all, investing your money. Graham believes that there is no good reason to not invest your money, as it is the closest thing to a bank with really high interests (if done properly).

He also stressed the importance of investing for your future and showed me for the first time the power of compounding and how small changes can have great impacts later on in life. And I wanted those changes.

### The first step

After deciding I wanted in on the action, I started doing a lot of research. I wanted to invest in the stock market, have my money on index funds and do it consistently for the rest of my days.

So I started looking at the best online brokers available in Portugal, the ones with the lowest commissions, most markets available (I barely knew what this meant, I only wanted to have more options), and the best looking as well, which is obviously essential when choosing where to invest.

I settled for Degiro, which at the time seemed like the best option. I created an account, convinced my parents it would be a good idea (by this time I had turned 18, but it was good to consult them anyway), and put my money where my mouth was. The result was nothing short of a disaster.

### Ambition Problems

By the time I was creating the account and getting into the world of investments, I also found out about a thing called day trading. This was mainly through a channel called [Warrior Trading](https://www.youtube.com/user/DaytradeWarrior), which is not that bad and has great tips, but the problem is that it requires a totally different setup.

Whilst regular investing is all about slow and steady commitments and patience, day trading is fast, hectic, and requires razor-sharp attention and focus. I was hooked on the possible gains I could make, which were a lot if you did things right, which I did not, and neglected everything else. Without no experience and zero tools suitable for the job, I started day trading on Degiro.

What happened was that after about a week or something, I had lost nearly 20% of the money I had invested initially and was panicking at every attempt to "trade" I did. I was digging myself a deeper hole every time, and the only thing I wanted to do was to quit and never look at investing again.

On the final day that I tried this strategy, I had just lost like another 10% and was raging uncontrollably on the inside. So I just sort of went on the search, looked up two companies that I liked (Farfetch and AMD), and put all the rest of my money on them. This turned out to be one of the best decisions ever.

First of all, I stopped looking at the money I had or owned or whatever. I stopped worrying. I saw the numbers occasionally and didn't do much with them. Secondly, and best of all, those companies blew up just at the time I bought them, so I wasn't in a rush to sell.

This is what made me appreciate slow investing again, and soon enough I realized its value. I kept those stocks for around 6 months and sold them not only to cover my losses but make a huge profit along the way. This experience taught me patience. I was lucky, that's true, but it showed me that waiting for the market is much better than trying to predict it at any point.

## Losing Track

Although throughout this time I was still looking into investing and finance, I never actually tried to expand much besides those two stocks. University was keeping me too busy, sadly.

After selling those stocks, I never really got back on track and looked for other options, I collected the money and never reinvested it. Why this happened remains a mystery even for me to this day. The fact is that for the next year, I never invested again, and after that, I decided to close my account and not look back at it again.

It was a really bad decision. I should have kept on investing, doing it consistently, and expanding my portfolio. It would cost me nothing, and I would get the advantage of time on my side. To this day I still regret those decisions (or lack of them).

That's why I am going to change this.

## The plan for the future

From now on, things will be different. I cannot get my lost time back, but I can make up for it as much as I can. I have decided that I want to FatFIRE early in my life and do it with Daniela. So we will start investing as much as possible, and do it consistently like I should have done a long time ago.

Each of us will put money there regularly, not panic selling and overall not worrying about that money, knowing that in the future it will certainly pay off.

This is the plan at least. In reality, things may turn out very differently. We don't know. What we do know is that by not starting right now we are already missing out. So let's get to it.
