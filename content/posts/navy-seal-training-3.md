For the first time since the start of this challenge, I started this week off with a blast. When Monday came, and the big exam was done, I immediately decided it was time for a change. Now that only a single exam remains, and one that I am hoping to be quite the easy challenge, I finally had the time to kill it in my workouts and give my all without the fear of falling behind in university. That translated right away into better performance in the gym from the get-go. Here are some of the highlights from each day:

## Day 1 - The planning

Monday was my long-distance running day, and it turned out to be an absolute blast. Before even starting to work out, I decided that it would be a day of mental rest, as I still had a lot of time to study, and for me, the best mental recovery there is, comes from exercising. For some reason, it always feels like my brain finally shuts down for a while and relaxes when I am running or lifting weights.

Also, I was getting tired of trying to plan my workouts in my notes apps and trying to coordinate everything from there, so I ported everything I had into [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), my to-do app of choice, and made myself a little "workout tracker". It is not ideal but for me, it works well enough and I seem to get more done when I can cross everything from my Today view, as it is super satisfying. It was a bit of a rough change and cost me a lot of time from the actual workout, but since I made this day a day off, I quickly stopped worrying about it.

## Day 2 - Crushing Leg Day

The worst days of the week are without a doubt leg days. Even though I don't actually mind training legs, and there are some exercises that I now do and that I wanted to be doing a long time now, the day after leg day always sucks. To make matters worse, leg days are always the day after running days, so my legs are already sore when I enter the gym. But with my determination for the week, I managed to "ignore" all that and keep going, which turned out pretty well.

I made some progress on the machine exercises, like leg press and extensions, and for the first time felt I was ready to try to do actual deadlifts and squats with a barbell. Now I can finally try some of the compound lifts that I always wanted to do, but never knew how to do them. Even though I am very weak at them, I feel like I can make good progress if I am consistent.

## Day 3 - Maxing out Reps

On day 3 I decided I was not making enough progress with my push-ups and sit-ups. I want to be able to do at least 100 push-ups in sets by around week 6 and at the current pace that was not working. So instead of trying to only increase my reps weekly, I decided to increase them daily. And that is how I went from 65 to 70 push-ups in a day. The same thing happened with sit-ups, but progress was much easier. Even though my core hurts almost every day, sit-ups are relatively simple to do and can max them out easily (maybe it is because I am not focusing enough on the core, but the other exercises help a lot with it). As such I can make an evolution every day, which is a great motivation booster for keep crushing these workouts.

## Day 4 - A more relaxed day

Thursday is almost my mid-week rest day. It is only a day for push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and the core routine, with no running or cardio of any form. So even though I still got to grind out 75 push-ups and give my all for the pull-ups, there is not much else after that (the core routine is meant more for stability and balance than actual strength gains). As such, these days are optimal candidates for implementing a stretching routine, which I desperately need (I am the most non-flexible person I know), so it would be a good complement to the strength training.

## Day 5 - A slight twist

Friday was supposed to be my upper body and running day but turned out to be one of the best workouts I ever had. Instead of running alone, the cardio consisted of playing a few hours of futsal with my friends from university. And it also happened that I had my last exam that morning, so I felt even better to go out and do something super fun. It was a blast, we played almost non-stop for 2 hours and a bit, and in the end, everyone was exhausted, but not for one moment did I want to stop. After all that I could barely walk home, much less go to the gym. But the energy expended and work done made it a worthy tradeoff.

## Day 6 - An absolute wreck

The aftermath of a day like that, however, is not all that fun. During the night I was still fine, just really tired, but when the morning came it all hit at once. I could barely move a single leg muscle and absolutely everything felt sore. This is what happens when the university work makes me sit down almost the entire day, the muscles start to degrade heavily and weaken a lot. Needless to say, I couldn't go to the gym to do leg day, as I almost couldn't make it out of my bed waking up and had to drag myself out of it. Still, I regret nothing and would play all day again (just let me rest for a few days now).

# Rounding out the week

All in all, it was one of my most physically active weeks of the year, and one I am very proud of for sticking to so well. I probably wouldn't have done it if my girlfriend didn't motivate me on some days, so kudos to her as well. Now, even though I am still hurt from Friday (I am writing this on Sunday and still can barely walk), I am ready to take on another week that will leave me absolutely wrecked and craving for more, all while developing a great physique along the way. Couldn't ask for a better start to my year. See you later!
