After such an intensive week like week 3, week 4 started out in a really slow fashion.

It was impressive how little physical stamina I had up to this point, and Friday and the futsal game really showed it. The coming days were challenging as hell, with Saturday and Sunday me being barely able to move my muscles and lift my legs, which led to me not leaving the house at all.

Saturday I would be crazy to try to train, since it was leg day worst of all, and after my rest day I still wasn't feeling up to it, so Monday I decided to not go for it either. I had to break the chain that I was building so well up to that point, but I really needed the rest or I would start to get real problems.

After Monday though, I started feeling fine again, and so Tuesday I went onward with my progress

## Tuesday - Shaking things up

As I came to workout on Tuesday, I had also scheduled a physical evaluation that the gym offers, just to see how I was doing.

It was a bit sad to realize that during this time, I had actually gained fat and not that much muscle, so the workouts weren't adding up to much. Something had to change. Luckily for me, the coach that gave me the evaluation also provided me with a full workout regimen to improve my strength.

I took the advice he gave very seriously, and after talking with him to see my goals, the workout I got was the perfect complement to this "challenge". It trains every part of my body completely, and includes some of the heavy compound lifts I always wanted to try, like military press, deadlift, squat and bench press.

All in all, I now had a comprehensive gym strength training, coupled with a solid core and calisthenics workout as well as a cardio routine. I had everything. The only thing that I need is to actually follow it.

## Wednesday - A first try out

The first day I used this full workout regimen was Wednesday and it was a blast. I started slow on some of the exercises, but always tried to reach failure in all of them. The end result is me being a complete wreck, but feeling as powerful as possible.

Also, during this time I was on vacation from school, so I really could afford to spend time perfecting my form.

## Thursday - One small day off

Up until this week I was in a complete frenzy to finish my exams and try to get the best grades possible in all of them. My girlfriend was doing the exact same thing. The problem with this is that we ended up studying and cramming on Valentine's Day, and barely had time for ourselves. What is the good part in the middle of this, you ask?

Well, Thursday we were both completely free, and since it was no longer Valentine's Day, we could have our very own special day without the huge crowds of people doing the same thing. And we did.

In the morning we went to explore around the Porto riverside, relaxed, and crossed the bridge over to Gaia. Here we had sushi for lunch, in a restaurant that on Valentine's was completely packed, but on this day was nearly empty, so we could have quality time to ourselves. After this we went to "Jardim do Morro" to appreciate the views, hopped on a bus and went over to the "Foz" area to play mini-golf!

It was a wonderful evening, and a good break from all the hustle and bustle of university.

## Friday - Making up for lost time

As Thursday I took a day off, Friday I made up for it, big time. I went to the gym a bit early, because we had our train in the afternoon, and tried to get myself as tired as possible in the short time I had. I quite easily succeeded in this endeavor, and came home exhausted, to pack and head home to Barcelos.

It was a kind of boring gym day, but I was starting to see some progress after a month of trying.

## Rounding out the week

The final days of the week I failed for a bit. On Saturday it was because I wasn't yet done adapting the routine to my new place for the week, where I wouldn't have a gym, but on Sunday I made up for it and did the workout I was meant to do Saturday.

All in all, this week was the start of a period of change. With the new workout coupling perfectly with the existing routine, some slight tweaks to my times and a newfound will, I now have every tool to have an impressive journey forward. Let's go out and get it!
