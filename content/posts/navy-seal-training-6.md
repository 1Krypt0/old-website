As the start of the new semester was rapidly approaching, I decided to make sure that I would follow up and nearly prioritize my training above almost all else (education is the major exception).

Also, since I had just finished reading Atomic Habits, one amazing book on building good habits, I decided to cast constant votes on the fit person identity I always try to achieve, but end up failing to.

# A contract for stability

One thing I read in the book that convinced me to take a step forward was the story of a young entrepreneur who wanted to lose weight but always failed, and decided to do what young entrepreneurs do best. He made a contract to lose weight, and made him, his wife, and his personal trainer sign it.

It included is goals and objectives for each quarter, and a nasty consequence if he failed. And the best part? He stuck to it. So I decided to try the same thing.
