      <description>This is the story of the best gift I ever received, and one of the best I probably will ever receive.
The Origin Story It all started when I turned 18. It is always a special occasion, and with me being born late in December, it was even more exciting after seeing all of my friends having their great parties and moments.
That year was also the year I started dating Daniela, so it was even better as it was my first birthday I would spend with a &amp;ldquo;special someone&amp;rdquo;, something every teen would love to have.</description>
