      <title>How I Trained to Look Like a Navy Seal - Week 6</title>

      <description>As the start of the new semester was rapidly approaching, I decided to make sure that I would follow up and prioritize my training above almost all else (education is the major exception).
This happenned because I noticed that, during some interviews for potential internships, no one really asked me about my grades or how good my results were. People only cared about what I produced.
So, if they don&amp;rsquo;t really care about my grades, and I am learning either way, then why should I spend nearly every single minute worried about each and every little detail that won&amp;rsquo;t make a big difference in the end?</description>

      <description>This was most definitely a week of adaptation. After the first week of vacations had passed, I went back to my hometown to be with my parents for a while. This led to some great times of course, but also some workout difficulties.
Choosing a new spot In previous times, I would be fine working out in Barcelos, as I had a gym close to home during summer break. The problem is that I only could go to that gym for summer break.</description>

      <description>After such an intensive week like week 3, week 4 started out in a really slow fashion.
It was impressive how little physical stamina I had up to this point, and Friday and the futsal game really showed it. The coming days were challenging as hell, with Saturday and Sunday me being barely able to move my muscles and lift my legs, which led to me not leaving the house at all.</description>

      <description>For the first time since the start of this challenge, I started this week off with a blast. When Monday came, and the big exam was done, I immediately decided it was time for a change. Now that only a single exam remains, and one that I am hoping to be quite the easy challenge, I finally had the time to kill it in my workouts and give my all without the fear of falling behind in university.</description>

      <description>Week 2 was yet another one of my terrific failures. It seems that the start of this challenge is going to be the worst part of them all. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right that after all the continuous hard work put in during the semester, I still have to complete exams on top of it (which sadly, most of them didn&amp;rsquo;t go as I expected). This little journey is also becoming a bit of a weekly insight into my life which is not the original plan, but one I don&amp;rsquo;t mind at all.</description>

      <title>How I Trained to Look Like a Navy Seal - Week 1</title>

      <description>I have to be honest, during week one I was terrible. Not because I found the training hard and was constantly sore from doing it, but because I didn&amp;rsquo;t even actually train in most of the days. It felt terrible doing this to myself, even more so when I was just starting and was supposed to at least try in the first week, it didn&amp;rsquo;t go at all according to plan.</description>

      <description>Navy SEALs are tough people, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt about it.
From David Goggins to Jocko Willink and all others, they can inspire everyone to become a better version of themselves. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what they did to me. I come from Portugal, but for a period of my life around the time I was 11 and dreamy, I was convinced I would join the SEALs, breeze through training and be a part of the elite, jumping from airplanes in enemy territory and going on crazy missions around the world, just like in the movies.</description>
