      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have to be honest, I have been slacking off a lot on my writing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t judge myself, my schedule has been a little chaotic lately and I have been having my priorities a little mixed up, and just not enough time to sit down and do some focused thinking that wasn&rsquo;t for work.</p>
<p>Most of my days were either spent focusing on keeping up with university work, which for a few days became pretty overwhelming, or handling other activities I do, which if they get out of control can take over all your time. And sometimes they did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to take it a bit easy and start establishing priorities. I would step back a bit from those activities and try to fully enjoy them but in moderation. When I am there, I am present and enjoying as most of the moment as possible. Otherwise, I would be better off focusing on doing things for the university, going to the gym, or even writing.</p>
<h1 id="needing-to-prioritize">Needing to prioritize</h1>
<p>When talking to a few of my friends about all that I like to do, I realized that 24 hours in a day are simply not enough to do everything I want and still find time to rest properly.</p>
<p>Between working out, university, being with my girlfriend, reading, writing, and being present in Praxe (an academic tradition from Portugal), and many other things I like to do, it is simply not enough to delegate and time block, if I want to enjoy all of them fully. So instead I make compromises.</p>
<p>Every week I define what are the most important things to do. Normally, it is a combination of university, Praxe, being with my girlfriend, and working, as I consider these the biggest pillars of my life. Then, I try to make time for all other things whenever possible.</p>
<p>Usually, I try to read in the more dull moments and write on the weekends when I have more continuous free time. Also, on the weekends, I make it a priority to be with my girlfriend, to compensate for all the time I have been distant during the week.</p>
<p>The system is not ideal, but it does become effective when you commit to it, and as I use it more and more, I get better at estimating times and delegating even better.</p>
<h1 id="speaking-of-working-out">Speaking of working out</h1>
<p>But I digress, this was supposed to be a progress journal for my workouts. Contrary to what might be expected, I worked out really well this week. I remained pretty consistent, only missing Saturday because I was at my girlfriend&rsquo;s house, but made steady progress in all exercise categories.</p>
<p>Also, I became really close to hitting one of my major milestones, getting to 100 push-ups in a workout. I am already up to 90, but I believe I can progress steadily, and by next week hit my milestone.</p>
<p>Now that I am bulking up I should also try to lift a lot heavier, and maybe reduce the number of reps a bit, to try and reach overload on the weights and increase them consistently. Overall I am liking the progress a lot.</p>
<p>Also, it is pretty cool to see it in action, looking back at the weights with which I started and what I am up to now, it feels Nice. Also, I have noticed that sometimes the workouts have become a little boring as of late, maybe I should try to mix them up a bit, as I did with my core training, to make it interesting and novelty again.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>This idea to start this workout has been one of the best I ever decided to embark on. Even though it feels like it is just starting, I am almost halfway through my journey, and seeing the progress I have been doing, it seems amazing. Hopefully, when it is all over, I can start yet another workout series that will be even more demanding, and challenging, but will allow me to be much more successful.</p>
<p>I have been working out seriously for around a year and a half now, and I am really proud of what I am becoming. Keep up with this every day, and let the progress speak for itself. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>
