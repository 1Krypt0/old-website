        <p>Week 2 was yet another one of my terrific failures. It seems that the start of this challenge is going to be the worst part of them all. And it doesn&rsquo;t feel right that after all the continuous hard work put in during the semester, I still have to complete exams on top of it (which sadly, most of them didn&rsquo;t go as I expected). This little journey is also becoming a bit of a weekly insight into my life which is not the original plan, but one I don&rsquo;t mind at all.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-challenger-appears">A new challenger appears</h1>
<p>After all the hard work that was put into projects, it becomes even more draining to condense the materials of a whole semester of classes and memorize them in two to three days, and then rinse and repeat until all 5 classes are done. This takes its toll on someone. Especially someone like me, who during that time magically became terrible at coordinating his life, and found himself struggling to do anything besides memorizing facts for a whole week. But that made me realize something a bit obvious to some people but for me, it needed to hit me in the face to be noticed.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-consistency">The power of consistency</h2>
<p>During my two-day fiestas of memorization, I noticed that when I took things slow and allowed my brain some time to process stuff, I recalled better than when I tried to look at things nonstop and think constantly. It is just like doing exercise. Rest is as important as actual training because it is then that your muscles develop. The brain works in just the same way. So, while for now I can&rsquo;t go back and change my whole semester, I can try to improve forwards. Instead of being the person that never goes to class (something I abused quite heavily this semester), I will be the person that tries in every class to get the essential so that everything is already well understood come exam season.</p>
<p>Notice that I said, &ldquo;I will be the person&rdquo;. This is important. Recently I have learned that to make new habits stick, it is essential to change not only the objective you are headed for, your goals, or in this case, me not having another insomnia-inducing study night, but also what you believe in. It is much easier to stop smoking by saying &ldquo;I am not a smoker&rdquo; than &ldquo;I am trying to quit&rdquo;. One has an identity conflict, and people tend to act according to their identity more than anything else. So if you want to change something in your life, and it is something that will help you a ton, start by changing your identity to be the person who gets what you want. That is what will do this semester. I will be the good student and the fitness dude and will succeed in both (This is the point where the narrator says that I couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong, let&rsquo;s hope he isn&rsquo;t hearing).</p>
<h1 id="in-the-coming-future">In the coming future</h1>
<p>This week made me realize that I wasn&rsquo;t getting my objectives, not because of a simple lack of time or motivation or energy, but a whole infrastructure of small mistakes that I did and lead to this moment. From now on, I won&rsquo;t be that person anymore. Week 3 is going to show just that. Also, when the second semester comes, I will do what I can to try and make the journey as smooth as possible. This includes paying attention to classes, trying to follow a system for learning consistently that works, and overall just dedicating more time to being the person I want to be in the future. It will take some time to plan, but looking at all the tiny things I can improve in life can and will make the difference. So let&rsquo;s get to it. Today marks the start of a new me.</p>
