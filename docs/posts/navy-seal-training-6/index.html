        <p>As the start of the new semester was rapidly approaching, I decided to make sure that I would follow up and prioritize my training above almost all else (education is the major exception).</p>
<p>This happenned because I noticed that, during some interviews for potential internships, no one really asked me about my grades or how good my results were. People only cared about what I produced.</p>
<p>So, if they don&rsquo;t really care about my grades, and I am learning either way, then why should I spend nearly every single minute worried about each and every little detail that won&rsquo;t make a big difference in the end?</p>
<p>Exactly, I shouldn&rsquo;t, especially not with everything else I could develop in that free time. Hence the wacky, out of nowhere decision that I hope brings good results.</p>
<p>Also, since I had just finished reading Atomic Habits, one amazing book on building good habits, I decided to cast constant votes on the fit person identity I always tries to achieve, but ended up failing to do so.</p>
<h1 id="a-contract-for-stability">A contract for stability</h1>
<p>One thing I read in the book that convinced me to take a step forward was the story of a young entrepreneur who wanted to lose weight and always failed, and decided to do what young entrepreneurs do best. He made a contract to lose weight, and made him, his wife, and his personal trainer sign it.</p>
<p>It included his goals and objectives for each quarter, and a nasty consequence if he failed. And the best part? He stuck to it. So I decided to try the same thing.</p>
<p>I got together with Daniela one weekend and decided what were the main points I was trying to develop myself in. It included the obvious like writing more and sticking to the routine, but also small things that I never got myself to do like reading more, or investing my money.</p>
<p>Also, we thought of consequences for every thing that I didn&rsquo;t do, ranging from being forced to take ice baths for a few days, to really bad things like spending a whole day without using any technology (my worst nightmare).</p>
<p>In the end I printed it out in a fancy font, asked her to sign it, and to keep me as accountable as possible during that time.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-accountability">The power of accountability</h2>
<p>The best part? It works! Everytime I wake up and start planning my day I immediately remind myself of the contract that is in my backpack and the consequences it presents, and I get to doing stuff right away! It is incredible how effective it is!</p>
<p>In fact, the first days I did it, in Barcelos for the last time, I didn&rsquo;t miss a single day and was on time not only for that, but for everything else I set out to do. It really felt empowering, for some strange reason. Instead of limiting me, it set me free to do the things I most wanted to do.</p>
<p>This was the last week in the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; part of the workout, and after Saturday everything would start to increase again. This meant I needed to be in top shape for all that I would do. Working out consistently really helped me achieve this goal.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-the-origins">Back to the origins</h1>
<p>On Wednesday, classes started again. And for the first time in 2 years, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a single remote class. Everything is in-person now.</p>
<p>It was great because I would see everyone again, but at the same time not, since it gives me much more constraints when it comes to my schedule. Luckily for me, I had the contract to force me to schedule things out, and boy did it work.</p>
<p>Back at the gym I would spend much more time working out, because I would have access to all the weights again and could actually do the full work, but everything was under control, because I gave it just the right amount of time for the job.</p>
<p>Also, doing the full workout is so much more fun! I am really enjoying all the new lifts and techniques I am developing, and the whole progress I am making day after day. It really puts me in a good mood for the week.</p>
<h2 id="smashing-records">Smashing records</h2>
<p>The best way to show for this work is the fact that I beat my records in all the exercises I did this week. Granted, it is still the beginning, and I am finding my actual weight limits, but for example, for the first time ever, I managed to do 90 push-ups in great form. Never in my life did I imagine I would hit such a large number!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these little victories that really make me feel I have made significant progress, and make me want to continue working out day after day.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up-the-week">Wrapping up the week</h1>
<p>In the end, I ended up having one of the most fullfilling weeks of workout in a long time. With the introduction of the gym, the contract and the record smashing, it is incredibly motivating to see what I can achieve with a little dedication and a sound plan.</p>
<p>It is still in the beginning, but I am already feeling it&rsquo;s gonna have a tremendous impact on my life. Let&rsquo;s hope I can keep this momentum going to the next week. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>
