        <p>As I look back into this week, I can see that it was destined for failure from the get-go.</p>
<p>Although this time I had brought everything and felt prepared for the rest of the day, it quickly became quite overwhelming.</p>
<h1 id="busy-scheduling">Busy scheduling</h1>
<p>Monday was still an easy day, just like every other day. I woke up early, did my full workout quite relaxed knowing I had an extra 30 minutes, and headed to class. During the afternoon, I pretty much had a free day after a small meeting and studying.</p>
<p>The problem came around every single other day, where it seemed like I couldn&rsquo;t catch a break.</p>
<p>Tuesday I had my evening busy, I still worked out but came home exhausted. Wednesday the same thing happened, and even though I had one of the best nights ever at university, it wasn&rsquo;t good for my recovery, and I ended up sleeping only around 3h that night.</p>
<p>After that, I had a day full of classes where I struggled not to fall asleep, and at night off we go to another party, sleeping not much more that night as well.</p>
<h1 id="crashing-then-burning">Crashing, then burning</h1>
<p>And you may ask. How many times did I end up working out that week? 3 times. Only 3 times.</p>
<p>That meant that only on the second week of starting my new contract I had already broken it, which was quite the bummer. Nevertheless, I paid my &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, which in this case was giving Daniela some money for her to spend, and rethought how I organize my days.</p>
<p>Also, on Tuesday, I got a real eye-opener from two friends of mine who I admire a lot. They said that even though I was there, I was not present and focused on things, not living the full experience.</p>
<p>At the time it was rough to take it, as I thought I had worked really hard to just be there and thought that everything else would follow naturally. It didn&rsquo;t. I needed to actually work on being present as well, not just hope it would happen.</p>
<p>It made me sad and I started to rethink all I had done working up to that point. Being quite a neurotic person as well, it isn&rsquo;t easy to focus for too long. But I had to try. I knew it would one day pay off.</p>
<p>The rest of the week, I tried to make things right, look up everything I had forgotten, and made an effort to commit it to memory. It is a lot harder than it seems, being on top of everything, but I wanted to prove to them and myself that I was capable of being better, both physically and mentally.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>So even though this week I had one of the best nights ever, I also got one of the most shockingly eye-opening ones, that gave me the reality check I think I needed. I hope I can prove those friends wrong in the coming future.</p>
<p>Also, as I struggled to find a way to move on, I came across a little poem that led me on the right track once again.</p>
<p>It is called Invictus, which is Latin for &ldquo;unconquerable&rdquo;, and it made me think how in life, nothing good will ever come without my work, and the power is in me to overcome everything bad the world comes at me (if you want to hear Morgan Freeman reciting it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7q_vACVwq0">here you go</a>). After reading and re-reading it that Tuesday night, I felt that no matter how much of life may try to put me down, I am the master of my fate, and I am the captain of my soul. Have a great week guys.</p>
