        <p>During this week I must say that I was totally high on life.</p>
<p>I had a blast all week, managed to get a whole lot of work done, and even got to make an incredible trip along the way.</p>
<p>It was certainly exhausting, but it was one of the best weeks of this year.</p>
<p>But on the downside, in the middle of all this, I realized that I had forgotten something. To work out!</p>
<h1 id="a-filled-week">A filled week</h1>
<p>Monday started strong from the get-go. I went to the gym as planned, had classes in the morning, and even had time to go shopping afterward. And all this in the morning. During the afternoon, I studied hard, improved on some projects, and relaxed for a bit. At night, I went out with some friends. That&rsquo;s where the problems started.</p>
<p>Although it was really fun to spend the night with them and those moments are special, when I came home it was super late and I needed to sleep. This meant that I wouldn&rsquo;t be waking up at 6 A.M to work out as usual. I slept in to not be exhausted and woke up when it was time for class.</p>
<p>Two of the seven days had passed, and I already missed one day. According to my recently signed contract, I now had to go every single other day.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-my-beloved">Wednesday my beloved</h2>
<p>Wednesday was probably one of the best university days I had all semester, so far.</p>
<p>The first thing I did when I woke up was honor my contract and smashing my workout. I was extra motivated because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose to my contract. After that, classes went great, and I made a lot of progress on my projects. But after that came the best part. And that part was Praxe.</p>
<p>I am not going to get into too much detail about what Praxe is or my thoughts about it, because I believe that everyone should experience it for themselves and form their own opinion. I love it and think it is one of the best experiences one could get from university, but not everyone has the same opinion and it is indeed a heated topic. Maybe one day I can even write about it.</p>
<p>Either way, during this Praxe, I met up with friends from all years, we had lunch together, and after that, we got on the Subway headed to the &ldquo;Baixa&rdquo; region of Porto. Usually, the first-year students aren&rsquo;t responsible for doing things, and they only enjoy the moments we prepare for them. For this day, we made them a &ldquo;treasure hunt&rdquo; (more like geocaching) across the city.</p>
<p>First, we went to the &ldquo;Trindade&rdquo; fountain, where we hid the first of many rewards, went down the &ldquo;Aliados&rdquo; and made our way into the &ldquo;SÃ©&rdquo; Cathedral, the second location. We went to explore those areas, talking, having fun and everything. It was incredible.</p>
<p>Then we crossed the bridge into Gaia, relaxed for a bit, and even had time to take a few pictures. It was a really great time. Afterward, we had one more surprise for them, which was riding a boat across the Douro river!</p>
<p>We spent all afternoon together, and we were all hyped for it. In the end, we all had dinner together. Well, almost all.</p>
<p>I and some of my friends there went to another dinner that we had already agreed to go to, which made its way well into the night. When I got home it was once again way too late, which as you can probably guess meant I didn&rsquo;t wake up early enough for my workout.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-comeback">Trying to comeback</h2>
<p>I had missed my contract because of all the partying. It was surely not motivating, and it did make me a bit sad since it meant that I went out too much. But it gave me the motivation to go all out on those other days, to try and make up for what I did.</p>
<p>Friday and Saturday I gave my all, and by the end of the week, I was just as tired as any other week. It didn&rsquo;t feel bad anymore. The contract had done its job, giving me the motivation to keep on working.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>Even though I failed what I signed on paper that I would be committed to doing, it was for sort of valid reasons, and instead, I made memories that will for sure mark my time at this university. It was the first time we had an experience like that, and it is one I will cherish for a long time. To all of those who made it possible, a big word of appreciation.</p>
<p>And now talking to me, even though you failed, you also won. You know you can&rsquo;t keep going like that, so keep trying to compromise on certain aspects and be more balanced everywhere possible. Future you will thank you. Now keep being better every day!</p>
