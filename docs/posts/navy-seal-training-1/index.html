      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have to be honest, during week one I was terrible. Not because I found the training hard and was constantly sore from doing it, but because I didn&rsquo;t even actually train in most of the days. It felt terrible doing this to myself, even more so when I was just starting and was supposed to at least try in the first week, it didn&rsquo;t go at all according to plan. Why did this happen, you ask? Well, its a combination of pressure from the projects at university and an unsuited environment</p>
<h1 id="the-pressure-of-university-projects">The pressure of university projects</h1>
<p>By the time I had planned to start this training, classes were just about to finish. With the end of classes here come two things: the due dates for all projects and the start of exam season. I was prepared for neither of these.</p>
<p>The projects I had been working on them all semester and some of them were going well (two of them were delivered a few days before the due date, and another was just needing some final touches). But the last project, and the worst one of them all, was a total mess. It is really hard to make a project when the assignment in itself is terrible, and it was a horrible project, to begin with, in a class with absolutely no guidance and with bad and borderline stupid requirements, but it is even worse when a project for 2 people was all done by only one. That&rsquo;s what happened to me. The entire semester we had a clear division between what was to be done by who, and all my parts were completed on time and worked (even helping with some things along the way), but everything else never showed up.</p>
<p>That led to a two-day rush to just finish what was possible and try to get as much done to at least come up with a decent thing, also on my own on these times. The result was a near-total burnout and both physical and mental exhaustion. All to at least not straight up fail a terrible project. With all this, I lost two days of working out to make a project I am not even proud of and it only cost my entire willpower to wake up &ldquo;on time&rdquo; and take some time for physical exercise the rest of the week. Nevertheless, I tried to do some exercise the day after this, to try and take my mind off things, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same thing. I wasn&rsquo;t giving it my all, which is detrimental to building muscle.</p>
<p>After all this, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to recover, because straight after the projects were done we had 2 days to study for the upcoming exams, which lead to even more days filled with studying and little to no time for exercise.</p>
<h1 id="not-an-ideal-environment">Not an ideal environment</h1>
<p>The little time I had for actually working out, and with the remaining energy I had, the conditions weren&rsquo;t ideal for a productive &ldquo;gym&rdquo; session. I was with my girlfriend at the time, and we were in her room all day.</p>
<p>Even though Aveiro is a really good place to go out and run or work out, we couldn&rsquo;t do it because of several reasons. So, since going out to train was out of the question, I had to improvise with what I had in the room. It turned out there are a lot of things you can do with a little imagination, like using a filled suitcase for an overhead press, and jugs of water for dumbells, and it would be quite fun to figure out things like that if I had the time and energy to do so.</p>
<p>Figuring out these things when burnt out is, sadly, not ideal. It showed me that I can have a good (but not great) workout whenever and wherever with just a little imagination, but it lead to even more tiredness that I couldn&rsquo;t handle at the time.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>Out of the 6 days that I was supposed to work out, I did it to near completion for 2 days, and a half workout for another. Not the best of starts, that&rsquo;s a fact, but it taught me a lesson from the get-go. The conditions will not be easy at some times, and failure is inevitable when situations overwhelm us. To succeed, it is essential to have good planning and control of the day, and mostly, of ourselves. It is not going to be an easy journey, and now week 2 must start without the proper training, so I will need to give it my all. Let&rsquo;s make it count.</p>
